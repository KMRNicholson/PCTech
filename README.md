# README

This web application was developed for the CS2043 team project. It is hosted on Heroku.com with the address pctech.herokuapp.com and is developed using the Ruby on Rails web development framework.

It uses Rails 5. Must have rails and ruby installed on your machine. All gem dependencies should be located in the gemfile.

For the database, I set it up on my local with postgreSQL.

In order to run tests, simply use the built in rails test method.

The functionality of this web application is to simply render coordinate points from a file, and display it to the user in the browser. It uses three.js which is a massive javascript library that allows you to create and display 3D models.
